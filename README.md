# Trexity OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification for [Trexity's public APIs](https://trexity.com/developers).

This repository contains the source files for each supported version of the Trexity
public API. Each MAJOR API version can be found under `specs`. Every effort will be
made to ensure the API stability and backward compatabilty with all MINOR versions
within a MAJOR version.

## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
>
> An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

## Project Status

The Trexity OpenAPI Specification is currently in Early Availability. While the specification should be accurate, it is under active development. The structure of this repository may continue to evolve. If you encounter any inaccuracies or have feedback on how it can better suite your use case, please [open an issue](https://github.com/trexitycode/openapi/issues/new) to let us know.

## Prior Work

The organization for this project was heavily inspired by the [DigitalOcean OpenAPI project](https://github.com/digitalocean/openapi).
