  The status of the queried Shipment.

  (empty string) - Shipment is a draft. Shipments are considered a draft if they haven't been posted to the driver network yet and scheduling has been disabled.

  WAITING_FOR_ACCEPTANCE - Shipments that have been posted to the driver network, but waiting for a driver to accept them. When a shipment is posted the owning merchant's credit card is pre-authorized for the full shipment rate.

  EN_ROUTE_TO_PICKUP - Shipments where a driver has accepted and the driver is driving to the pickup location.

  ARRIVED_AT_PICKUP - Shipments where a driver has arrived at the pickup location.

  OUT_FOR_DELIVERY - Shipments where a driver is delivering a parcel.

  ARRIVED_AT_DELIVERY - Shipments where a driver has arrived at a parcel's the delivery location.

  CANCELLED - Shipments that have been cancelled.

  EXPIRED - Shipments that have been posted to drivers and have waited for acceptance longer than 7 days. Similar to being on hold, the shipment rate pre-authorization is reversed on the owning merchant's credit card, and these shipments can be re-posted at a later time.

  ON_HOLD - Shipments that have been posted but not accepted and have been explicitly removed from the driver network. All shipments that are on hold will have the shipment rate pre-authorization reversed on the owning merchant's credit card. Additionally, shipments on hold can be re-posted at a later time.
