description: |
  Specifies the start of the delivery window (i.e. the earliest time that the courier can complete the delivery).
  The second and millsecond time components of the date will be ignored.

  When specified, this value must match the start of a suggested delivery window.

  The delivery windows are unique to each of your locations within Trexity because they are determined by the market's pickup windows and each location's delivery SLA. A delivery SLA is the maximum amount of time a delivery can take (.e.g. 2 hours). The general formula for computing a delivery window for each pickup window is the following.

  ```
  deliveryWindowStart = pickupWindowStart
  deliveryWindowEnd = pickupWindowEnd + deliverySLA
  ```
