description: |
  Specifies the start of the deliver window for the shipment (i.e. the latest time that the driver can deliver the shipment).
  The second and millsecond time components of the date will be ignored.

  When specified, this value must match the end of the suggested delivery window indicated by the value of `deliverStartAt`.

  The delivery windows are unique to each of your locations within Trexity because they are determined by the market's pickup windows and each of your location's delivery SLA. A delivery SLA is the maximum amount of time a delivery can take (.e.g. 2 hours). The general formula for computing a delivery window for each pickup window is the following.

  ```
  deliveryWindowStart = pickupWindowStart
  deliveryWindowEnd = pickupWindowEnd + deliverySLA
  ```
