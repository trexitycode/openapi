  GeoJSON object that defines the path of the Shipment, taking into account multiple dropoffs (if any).

  GeoJSON is defined at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946

  We are defining the geometry of the path using an array of LineString, which in plain English means

  piecewise linear segments connected on the map.
