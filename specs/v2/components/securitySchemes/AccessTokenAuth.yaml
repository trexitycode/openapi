  This authentication stratigy requires an access token used as a 'Bearer' token.

  Currently access tokens are only obtained and used by trusted services.

  Example:
  ```
  // nodejs
  require('http').get('{server-url}/{endpoint}', {
    headers: {
      accept: 'application/json',
      authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN}`
    }
  }, (res) => {
    // ... handle response
  })
  ```
