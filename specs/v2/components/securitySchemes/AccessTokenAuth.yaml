  This authentication stratigy requires an access token used as a 'Bearer' token.

  Currently access tokens are only obtained and used by trusted services.

  Example:
  ```
  curl -X POST {server-url}/{path} \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -d '{ ...body... }'
  ```
