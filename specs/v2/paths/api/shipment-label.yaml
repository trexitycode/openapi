              JSONL text where each line represents a label encoded as a JSON object. Up to "numLabels" (from the delivery) labels are returned.

              Each label is an encoded JSON object with the following fields:

              - `label`: The label as a base64 encoded string with PNG format.
              - `mimeType`: The MIME type of the label. Default is `image/png`.

              **NOTE:** The example shows the response as a JSON encoded string, but in practice
              the response is actually JSON encoded objects separated by newline characters. This is
              a limitation of our OpenAPI renderer.
