  summary: Cancel delivery
  description: |
    Cancels a delivery. A cancelled delivery will no longer be able to be assigned to a courier. 

    Can only cancel deliveries that are in the `draft`, `pending`, `assigned`, or `in-transit` status.
    
    **If cancelling a delivery while `assigned` or `in-transit` then a cancellation fee will be charged.**
