  description: |
    Create a shipment and optionally schedule it for pickup. A rate for the shipment will be calculated at the same time.

    If you want to schedule for pickup use `pickupStartAt` and ensure it matches your market's pickup windows as listed [here](https://trexity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16940024932627-Trexity-Pickup-Windows).

    If no `pickupAddress` is specified then your primary location's address will be used as the pickup address.

    **Unexhaustive list of error codes.**

    - `unauthorized-requirements` = When the requirements specified don't match the requirements granted to the merchant
    - `pickup-address-unserviceable` = When the pickup address cannot be matched to any of the merchant's locations
    - `invalid-pickup-address` = When the pickup address is invalid
    - `invalid-delivery-address` = When the delivery address is invalid
    - `pickup-point-outside-zone` = When the pickup address is outside Trexity's service area
    - `invalid-input` = When there are issues with the input data provided
    - `invalid-delivery-data` = When there are issues with the data provided and the delivery cannot be created
    - `num-labels-too-large` = When numLabels is too large
    - `invalid-scanids` = When the scanId specified is already in use
    - `outside-operating-hours` = When the pickup or delivery time specified is outside the your delivery hours or Trexity's service hours
    - `invalid-scheduled-posting-date` = The scheduling fields are invalid and do not describe a valid pickup window
    - `unauthorized-numlabels` = When total numLabels for the delivery is too large
    - `pickup-address-outsidetaxboundary` = The pickup address is outside the merchant's location province
    - `merchant-disabled` = The merchant has been disabled
    - `missing-profile-details` = The merchant has an incomplete profile
    - `no-shipment-rate` = A delivery rate failed to be calculated due to delivery or pickup address geofencing error
