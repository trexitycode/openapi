  summary: Calculate delivery rate
  description: |
    Calculate the rate for a direct delivery from a single pickup address to a
    single delivery address.

    Returns the estimated distance (in meters), estimated travel duration (in
    seconds), and fee from the pickup address to the delivery address.

    If no `pickupAddress` is specified then the merchant's business address will
    be used as the pickup address.

    Review the [Usage Policy](/#section/Usage-Policy).

    The rate response will include estimates for post, pickup, and delivery time.

    Additionally, the properties `pickupAfter`, `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore` can be provided to indicate a
    pickup or delivery window. Otheriwse the next available pickup window (i.e. ASAP) is assumed.
