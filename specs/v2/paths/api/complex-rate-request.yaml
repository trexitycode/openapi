  summary: Create complex rate request
  description: |
    scheduledPostAt is considered deprecated. It is still supported, but at some point in the future, it will not be.
    If you want to schedule a shipment, please use exactly one of:
      1) pickupStartAt and an optional pickupEndAt (when to pickup by)
      2) deliverStartAt and an optional deliverEndAt (when to deliver by)

    If providing a value for `scheduledPostAt` then an approximate value for `pickupStartAt` will attempt to be calculated. If an appproximation
    cannot be determined, then no complex rate will be returned and an error will be returned.

    ---

    Queue a list of shipments for an optimally routed rate.

    The typical use case of this API is to provide multiple shipments (pickup &
    delivery) to this endpoint, which responds with a request ID to be polled
    asynchronously using the [Complex Rate status](/#operation/getComplexRateStatus)
    endpoint, and ultimately retrieving the rate using the [Complex Rate result](/#operation/getComplexRateResult)
    endpoint.

    Optionally, you can then take the rate ID provided in the rate result and
    have the shipments created in bulk using the [Bulk Shipment Creation](/#operation/createCreateBulkShipmentsRequest)
    endpoint.

    **Order ID**

    For each parcel across all shipments provided to this endpoint, the
    `orderId` must be unique. This allows us to refer back to the parcel by
    `orderId` in the result `errors` array.
