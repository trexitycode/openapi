    List deliveries that match the specified filters.

    ## Filtering By Dates

    When filtering by a date range both the `fromDate` and `toDate` query parameters must be provided. **The maximum date range is 90 days.**

    ## Filtering By External ID

    When filtering by a delivery's external ID you **cannot filter by dates**. Filtering by dates and external ID are mutually exclusive filters. If `externalId` is specified it will take precendence.
