    Gets the actual JPG image data of the driver's pickup.

    This is used as a confirmation that the driver has picked up the parcel,
    and ideally should be on the way to delivery.

    You may assume this photo exists if the Status of the Shipment is at least 'Out for delivery'.

    Please see [shipments](/#operation/getShipment) for the possible statuses a Shipment may have.
