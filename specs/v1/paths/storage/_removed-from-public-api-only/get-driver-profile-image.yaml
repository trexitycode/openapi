    Gets the actual JPG image data of the driver's profile photo.

    N.B. You are allowed to see the driver's profile photo only when that driver is delivering a Shipment for you (as a Merchant).

    Our recommendation is that you cache the image once you have it available. Please note we provide [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) header for caching purposes.

    You may assume you are allowed to retrieve a specific driver's photo if there's a Shipment  that belongs to you and is in progress and shipment.driverId matches the user id of that driver.

    For more information, please see [here](/#operation/getShipment).
