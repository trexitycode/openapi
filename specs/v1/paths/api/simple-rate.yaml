  summary: Simple rate
  description: |
    Calculate the rate for a direct shipment from a single pickup address to a
    single delivery address.

    Returns the estimated distance (in meters), estimated travel duration (in
    seconds), and fee from the pickup address to the delivery address.

    If no `pickupAddress` is specified then the merchant's business address will
    be used as the pickup address.

    **(new in v1.7)** Review the [Usage Policy](/#section/Usage-Policy).

    **(new in v1.8)** Use this endpoint for direct shipment rates (single pickup
    address and single delivery address), and use the new [Complex Rate](/#operation/createComplexRateRequest)
    endpoint for multiple delivery addresses.

    The rate response will now include estimates for post, pickup, and delivery time.
    Additionally, the new properties `pickupAfter`, `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore` can be provided to indicate a
    delivery window. Otheriwse ASAP is assumed. Use the estimated scheduled post
    date in the response when creating the shipment.

    **(changed in 1.13)** Restore the behaviour prior to v1.13; if no value is specified for `pickupAfter`, `deliverAfter`
    or `deliverBefore`, then no time constraint or operating hours checks will be performed. However, if
    any of the time constraint properties mentioned are provided, then the time constraints much be achievable,
    and they must be within the merchant's and Trexity's operating hours, otherwise no rates will be returned with a status of 404.

    ### ASAP
    To simulate an ASAP delivery AND check operating hours set `pickupAfter` to `new Date()` or to avoid time drift between your server and Trexity use the value `"ASAP"`.
    Otherwise, the timing estimates returned will still assume an ASAP delivery, but without time constraint or operating hours checks.
