  summary: Simple rate
  description: |
    Calculate the rate for a direct shipment from a single pickup address to a
    single delivery address.

    Returns the estimated distance (in meters), estimated travel duration (in
    seconds), and fee from the pickup address to the delivery address.

    If no `pickupAddress` is specified then the merchant's business address will
    be used as the pickup address.

    **(new in v1.7)** Review the [Usage Policy](/#section/Usage-Policy).

    **(new in v1.8)** Use this endpoint for direct shipment rates (single pickup
    address and single delivery address), and use the new [Complex Rate](/#operation/createComplexRateRequest)
    endpoint for multiple delivery addresses.

    **(new in 1.10)** The rate response will now include estimates for post, pickup, and delivery time.
    Additionally, the new properties `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore` can be provided to indicate a
    delivery window. Otheriwse, ASAP is assumed.
