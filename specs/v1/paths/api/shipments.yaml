  summary: List shipments

    List shipments that match the specified filters.

    ## Filtering By Dates

    When filtering by a date range both the `fromDate` and `toDate` query parameters must be provided.

    ## Filtering By External ID

    When filtering by a parcel's external ID you **cannot filter by dates**. Filtering by dates and external ID are mutually exclusive filters. If `externalId` is specified it will take precendence.
    **(added in v1.2)**

    ## ~~Filtering By Parcel Metadata~~

    ~~Parcel metadata fields can be filtered on by using query parameters with the following pattern `meta_{fieldName}`.~~

    ~~Additionally, the metadata field must have been saved as a string, and not a number for example. This is required since
    the query parameter value is not converted to a number.~~

    ~~Example: `https://{server-url}/shipments?meta_partnerShipmentId=someid`~~
    **(deprecated in v1.2)**
