    **(CHANGE AS OF MAY 25, 2023)** scheduledPostAt is considered deprecated. It is still supported, but at some point in the future, it will not be.
    If you want to schedule a shipment, please use exactly one of:
      1) pickupStartAt/pickupEndAt (pickup windows)
      2) deliverStartAt/deliverEndAt (delivery windows)

    when you are scheduling a shipment.

    **(CHANGE AS OF DEC 1, 2022)** All `scheduledPostAt` values must be within **8:00am-11:00am, 11:00am-2:00pm, and 2:00pm-5:00pm local time (inclusive)**.

    Additionally, `scheduledPostAt` cannot be set to a value within the current time window or in the past. A time window is current when
    the local time of the pickup address enters the time window.

    For example: If the current time is 9AM local time, then you can only set `scheduledPostAt` to 1PM or later on the same day.

    For example: If the current time is 2PM local time, then you can only set `scheduledPostAt` to 8AM or later the following day.

    You can still schedule in the future, but the `scheduledPostAt` value needs to be within one of the time windows described above.

    ---

    Create a new shipment.

    If no `pickupAddress` is specified then the merchant's business address will be used as the pickup address.

    List shipments that match the specified filters.

    ## Filtering By Dates

    When filtering by a date range both the `fromDate` and `toDate` query parameters must be provided.

    ## Filtering By External ID

    When filtering by a parcel's external ID you **cannot filter by dates**. Filtering by dates and external ID are mutually exclusive filters. If `externalId` is specified it will take precendence.
    **(ADDED IN v1.2)**

    ## Filtering By Parcel Metadata
    **(DEPRECATED AS OF v1.2)**

    ~~Parcel metadata fields can be filtered on by using query parameters with the following pattern `meta_{fieldName}`.~~

    ~~Additionally, the metadata field must have been saved as a string, and not a number for example. This is required since
    the query parameter value is not converted to a number.~~

    ~~Example: `https://{server-url}/shipments?meta_partnerShipmentId=someid`~~
