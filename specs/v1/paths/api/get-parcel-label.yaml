              **(ADDED IN v1.27)** JSONL text where each line represents a label encoded as a JSON object. Up to "numLabels" (from the parcel) labels are returned.

              Each label is an encoded JSON object with the following fields:

              - `label`: The label as a base64 encoded string with PNG format.
              - `mimeType`: The MIME type of the label. Default is `image/png`.

              **NOTE:** The example shows the response as a JSON encoded string, but in practice
              the response is actually JSON encoded objects separated by newline characters. This is
              a limitation of our OpenAPI renderer.

              See: https://jsonlines.org/
          example: |
            {"label": "...base64encodedstring...", "mimeType": "image/png"}
            {"label": "...base64encodedstring...", "mimeType": "image/png"}

        Parcel does not have a label.
        This means that the Merchant is responsible for creating the labels.
