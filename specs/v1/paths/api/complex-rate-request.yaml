  summary: Create complex rate request
  description: |
    Queue a list of shipments for an optimally routed rate.

    **NOTE: This request performs a complex route optimization operation. This may take up to
    several minutes to complete. Keep this in mind when setting values for the timing
    properties `scheduledPostAt`, `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore`. After the operation
    completes the `scheduledPostAt` could be in the past and shipments could be posted
    immediately after they are created.**

    The typical use case of this API is to provide multiple shipments (pickup &
    delivery) to this endpoint, which responds with a request ID to be polled
    asynchronously using the [Complex Rate status](/#operation/getComplexRateStatus)
    endpoint, and ultimately retrieving the rate using the [Complex Rate result](/#operation/getComplexRateResult)
    endpoint.

    Optionally, you can then take the rate ID provided in the rate result and
    have the shipments created in bulk using the [Bulk Shipment Creation](/#operation/createCreateBulkShipmentsRequest)
    endpoint.

    **Order ID**

    For each parcel across all shipments provided to this endpoint, the
    `orderId` must be unique. This allows us to refer back to the parcel by
    `orderId` in the result `errors` array.

    **Scheduled Post At**

    If `scheduledPostAt` is not given and `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore` are provided
    then a value for `scheduledPostAt` will be estimated and computed for each shipment payload.

    **(new in v1.10)** The new properties `deliverAfter` and `deliverBefore` can be provided that describe a
    delivery window for delivery. From these values a `scheduledPostAt` will be estimated and used when creating shipments.
