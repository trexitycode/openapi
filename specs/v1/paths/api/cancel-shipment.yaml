  description: >
    Cancels a shipment. A cancelled shipment will no longer be able to be posted to drivers. 
    Additionally, the merchant will be charged a cancellation fee if a driver has already accepted the shipment.

    Can only cancel shipments that have a `currentStatus` of
    WAITING_FOR_ACCEPTANCE, EN_ROUTE_TO_PICKUP, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY,
    RENOUNCED_BY_DRIVER, or ON_HOLD.
