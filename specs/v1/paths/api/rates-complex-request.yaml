    Queue a list of shipments for optimal routing and pricing.

    The typical use case of this API is to select all your shipments and
    provide them in bulk to this endpoint, which responds with an asynchronous
    request ID. Then, use this asynchronous request ID to obtain the
    status of the request and later the result.

    **Order ID**

    For each shipment provided to this endpoint, the `orderId` must be unique
    among all parcels. This allows us to refer back to the parcel by `orderId`
    in the result `errors` array.

    **Scheduled Post At**

    Values for `scheduledPostAt` must be a date at least 1 hour from the time of
    the request. This helps to ensure that there is enough time for the optional
    bulk shipment creation request to be performed and fully completed before
    the driver network is notified of the deliveries.
