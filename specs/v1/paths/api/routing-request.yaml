    **(CHANGE AS OF DEC 1, 2022)** All `scheduledPostAt` values must be within **8:00am-1:00pm and 1:00pm-5:00pm local time (inclusive)**.

    Additionally, `scheduledPostAt` cannot be set to a value within the current time window or in the past. A time window is current when
    the local time of the pickup address enters the time window.

    For example: If the current time is 9AM local time, then you can only set `scheduledPostAt` to 1PM or later on the same day.

    For example: If the current time is 2PM local time, then you can only set `scheduledPostAt` to 8AM or later the following day.

    You can still schedule in the future, but the `scheduledPostAt` value needs to be within one of the time windows described above.

    Queue a list of parcels to be routed and added to optimized shipments.

    The typical use case of this API is to select all your parcels and
    provide in bulk to this endpoint, which responds with an asynchronous routing
    request ID. Then use this asynchronous routing request ID to obtain the
    status of the routing request and later the result.

    **Order ID**

    For each parcel provided to this endpoint, the `orderId` must be unique among
    all parcels. This allows us to refer back to the parcel by `orderId` in the
    result `errors` array.

    **Note on Optimization**
    This endpoint does not use our most up-to-date routing optimization technology. We
    recommend using the [Complex Rate](/#operation/createComplexRateRequest) endpoint instead.

    **(DEPRECATED AS OF v1.8)** Use the new [Complex Rate](/#operation/createComplexRateRequest)
    endpoint, combined with the [Create Shipments](/#operation/createCreateBulkShipmentsRequest) endpoint.
