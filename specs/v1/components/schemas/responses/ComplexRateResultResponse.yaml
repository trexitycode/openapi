          This rate response is persisted for 7 days, and can be converted to
          shipments using the [Bulk Shipment Creation](/#operation/createCreateBulkShipmentsRequest)
          endpoint, and this rateId. Please note that pricing may differ
          between this rate response and the creation process, where the
          likelihood of drift increases with time.
