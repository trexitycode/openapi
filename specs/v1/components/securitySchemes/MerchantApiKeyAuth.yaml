  This authentication strategy uses a Trexity Merchant API KEY. This API KEY is used
  as a bearer token.

  In order to obtain a Trexity Merchant API key, you need to sign-up as Merchant at https://merchant.trexity.com/
  and create an API KEY through your merchant portal.

  Feel free to contact support@trexity.com for any questions you may have.

  Example:
  ```
  curl -X POST {server-url}/rates/simple \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Merchant API Key>' \
    -d '{
      "pickupAddress": "9 Slack Rd, Nepean ON K2G 0B7, CA",
      "deliveryAddress": "207 Queen St, Ottawa ON K1P 6E5, CA",
