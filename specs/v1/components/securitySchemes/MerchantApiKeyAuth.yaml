  This authentication strategy uses a Trexity Merchant API KEY. This API KEY is used
  as a bearer token.

  In order to obtain a Trexity Merchant API key, you need to sign-up as Merchant at https://merchant.trexity.com/
  and create an API KEY through your merchant portal.

  Feel free to contact support@trexity.com for any questions you may have.

  Example:
  ```
  curl -X POST {server-url}/shipment-rates \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Merchant API Key>' \
    -d '{
      "pickupAddress": "9 Slack Road, Ottawa ON, CA",
      "deliveryAddresses": ["123 Slater Street, Ottawa ON, CA"],
      "requirements": {},
      "orderValue": 2500
