    "description": "# Migrating to v2\n\nThis version of the API is a major departure from v1. We normalize around the concept of a shipment\nand provide a more consistent API. All endpoints are now shipment centric, and all webhook events\nare relative to a shipment.\n\n**Breaking Changes**\n\n- the concepts of a \"shipment\" and a \"parcel\" have been merged together into a [shipment](#tag/Shipments)\n- shipment IDs from v1 that were created from the \"Create a shipment\" endpoint will work when performing shipment read operations in v2, but the shipment ID returned will be different\n- parcel IDs from v1 will work as-is for shipment IDs in v2 with no exceptions\n- the complex rate endpoints have been replaced with a new set of [batching endpoints](#tag/Batching) that will perform the same tasks\n- [addressing](#tag/Addresses) has been changed from a single address string with a format, to a structured [address object](#tag/Addresses)\n- the following webhook events have been replaced:\n  - `parcel.picked_up` with `shipment.picked_up`\n  - `parcel.delivered` with `shipment.delivered`\n  - `parcel.returning` with `shipment.returning`\n  - `parcel.returned` with `shipment.returned`\n  - `shipment.driver.accepted` with `shipment.courier.accepted`\n  - `shipment.driver.arrived_at_pickup` with `shipment.courier.arrived_at_pickup`\n  - `shipment.driver.arrived_at_delivery` with `shipment.courier.arrived_at_delivery`\n  - `shipment.driver.renounced` with `shipment.courier.renounced`\n- the following webhook events have been removed:\n  - `shipment.completed` use `shipment.delivered` or `shipment.undeliverable` instead\n  - `shipment.driver.parcel_delivered` use `shipment.delivered` instead\n  - `shipment.driver.picked_up` use `shipment.picked_up` instead\n  - `shipment.posted` use `shipment.courier.accepted` instead\n\n**Updates**\n\n- a new endpiont has been added to retrieve your [webhook secret](/#operation/getWebhookSecretKey)\n\n# Issues\n\nPlease open [bug reports](https://github.com/trexitycode/openapi/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) or [feature requests](https://github.com/trexitycode/openapi/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) in the [issues](https://github.com/trexitycode/openapi/issues) board.\n\n# Usage Policy\n\nBy using this API to provide shipment rates to your customers you agree to display the [Rate](#operation/getSimpleRate) `name` without modification.\nThe [Rate](#operation/getSimpleRate) `description` can be replaced with a custom value (e.g. Same-day, etc.) or displayed as-is from the Rate.\n\nThis allows Trexity to ensure consistent messaging wherever Trexity shipment rates are displayed to your customers.\n\n## Suspension & Termination\n\nFailure to comply with this Usage Policy may result in suspension of your Trexity merchant account and/or API Keys. Continued failure to comply may result in the termination of your Trexity merchant account.\n\n# Concepts & Workflows\n\n## Concepts\n\n**Shipment** represents an order, has pickup information and customer information.\n\n**Rate** represents a price for completing a shipment.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. [Calculate a shipment rate](#operation/calculateShipmentRates) by specifying pickup information, customer information and the delivery address to get a rate to show your customer and obtain an estimate for a pickup time\n2. [Create a shipment](#operation/createShipment) by specifying pickup information, customer information and the delivery address\n3. [Get shipment label](#operation/getShipmentLabel) for a shipment then affix to the shipment packaging\n4. [Listen for shipment events](#tag/Webhooks) to track the shipment until it is delivered\n\n## Sandbox Environment\n\nAll API operations have an alternate base URL available in the sandbox environment.\n\nTo use the sandbox environment:\n1. Create an account on the [Sandbox Merchant Portal](https://merchant.beta.trexity.com/signup)\n2. Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://merchant.beta.trexity.com/api/keys) in the Advanced area.\n3. Create a new API Key\n4. Use the new API Key and the sandbox base URL in your API requests\n\n> Use the dropdown in the top right of an API operation page to select the sandbox environment server.\n\n### Credit Cards\n\nWhen signing up for the sandbox environment you can use the  following\ncredit card with any 3-digit CVC and a future expiration date.\n\n```\n4000 0012 4000 0000\n```\n\n### Expectations\n\nThe sandbox environment is intended for development and testing purposes only.\nExpect latency to be higher than the production environment.\n\nWe use our sandbox environment as well when developing new features to ensure\nthere are no breaking changes. So expect the occasional breaking change when\nusing the sandbox environment.\n\n# Responses\n\n### Successful Responses\n\nAll endpoints, when responding successfully, will return a JSON object with a `data` field when there is data to return.\n```\n// typescript interface\ninterface SuccessResponse<T = object | any[]> {\n  data: T\n}\n```\n\n### Error Responses\n\nAll endpoints, when applicable and responding with a non 200 HTTP status code, will return a JSON object with an `errors` field.\n```\n// typescript interface\ninterface ErrorResponse {\n  errors: { message: string, code: string }[]\n}\n```\n"
